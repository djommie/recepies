INSTRUCTIONS
 
Put your pasta on to boil in salted water and cook according to pack instructions.
Finely chop the garlic, chop the mushrooms and onion and slice chilli removing the seeds. Pick the herb leaves from their stalks and chop.
To cook your mushrooms (oil free) Heat a large non stick pan over a high heat, add the onions and garlic, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2 minutes stirring occasionally, to brown slightly, when they begin to stick to the pan add a couple of tablespoons of veg the stock and continue to cook for another minute or two.
Add the chopped mushrooms and cook until they start to brown which will prob take 4-5 minutes, add a couple of tablespoons of veg stock if they start to stick. Once they have started to brown and have reduced add the tamari/soy sauce and stir mixing it around until it is all absorbed which will take about a minute.
For the cashew sauce, add all the ingredients to a blender and blend all the sauce ingredients on high speed until very smooth.
Drain and rinse the pasta, (keeping a mug of pasta water to help dilute the dish if needed) and put back in the pot. Add the sauce to cooked and drained pasta and cook for a couple of minutes until it thickens. Taste and season if need.
Serve the pasta and sauce and top each dish with the cooked mushrooms, a few slices of the sliced chilli and some thyme/oregano leaves. Enjoy!
